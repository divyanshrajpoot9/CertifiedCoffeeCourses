A media query in web development is a CSS technique used to apply styles to a webpage based on the characteristics of the device or browser viewing it. It allows developers to create responsive designs that adapt to various screen sizes, resolutions, and device capabilities.

Media queries use the `@media` rule in CSS to define a set of styles that will apply when certain conditions are met. These conditions are based on features like screen width, height, orientation, resolution, and more.

Here's the basic structure of a media query:

```css
@media (condition) {
  /* CSS styles to apply when the condition is true */
}
```

The `condition` is a logical expression that evaluates to true or false based on the characteristics of the device or browser. For example, you can specify a condition based on the maximum screen width:

```css
@media (max-width: 600px) {
  /* CSS styles to apply when the screen width is 600px or less */
}
```

In this example, the styles inside the media query block will only be applied when the maximum screen width is 600 pixels or less.

Commonly used conditions in media queries include:

- `min-width` and `max-width`: Specifying minimum and maximum screen widths for styles to apply.
- `min-height` and `max-height`: Specifying minimum and maximum screen heights for styles to apply.
- `orientation`: Applying styles based on the device orientation (portrait or landscape).
- `resolution`: Specifying the screen resolution for high-resolution displays (e.g., retina displays).

Media queries are an essential part of creating a responsive web design that ensures a seamless user experience across various devices, from desktop computers to smartphones. By adjusting the layout and styles based on the device's characteristics, developers can create websites that look and function well on different screens.
